# Screen Reference

This section intentionally avoids large inline screenshot walls.

## Why

Previous image-heavy pages were hard to scan and quickly became outdated.

## Current Standard

- Keep screenshots curated and release-tagged
- Prefer focused walkthroughs over dense galleries
- Use architecture and sequence diagrams for behavior explanation

## Screenshot Asset Rules

- Location: `static/img/screens/`
- Format: PNG
- Aspect: 20:9 preferred
- Naming: `<module>-<screen>-<state>.png`

Examples:

- `auth-login-default.png`
- `community-detail-member.png`
- `event-detail-admin.png`
- `tasks-update-modal.png`

## Suggested Coverage Set

- Authentication
- Community detail and settings
- Event detail with RSVP and agenda
- Tasks status update flow
- Finance summary and transaction detail
- Feed and comments
- Chat list and channel thread
- Notifications center
