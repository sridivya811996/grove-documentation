# Grove Enterprise Documentation

This documentation set is the canonical reference for Grove as an enterprise-grade micro-community product.

## What This Covers

- Product strategy and packaging
- Functional flows: auth, community, events, feed, finance, tasks, polls, notifications
- Technical architecture and sequence diagrams
- Supabase service mapping and security model
- Operations: feature flags, release governance, maintenance, and budgeting

## Source of Truth

This docs set is aligned with the current implementation in:

- App repo: `grove-community-app/grove-community`
- Backend schema and logic: `supabase/migrations`
- Mobile implementation: `app/`, `hooks/`, `lib/`, `stores/`

## Stakeholder Navigation

- `Product`: business model, roles, module scope
- `Functional Flows`: end-to-end user behavior and module behavior
- `Architecture`: high-level design, Supabase services, security, sequence diagrams
- `Operations`: runtime controls, release process, maintenance, cost control
- `Reference`: implementation inventory and glossary

## Current Product Positioning

Grove is intentionally **small by design**: a micro-community platform focused on quality interaction, clear governance, and configurable growth controls.

Suggested positioning line:

**Your people, your place.**
