title: Functional specification
---

This specification defines the Grove app scope for the MVP and the next phases. It reflects current product direction and avoids features that add risk before launch.

MVP scope (Phase 1)
- Authentication: Google sign-in plus email sign-up and sign-in
- Community creation: create, invite, and approve join requests where enabled
- Discovery: find communities that allow requests
- Member management: roles (owner/admin/member) and member removal
- Profiles: name, photo, and basic preferences
- Events and meetings: create, edit, RSVP, reminders
- Tasks and activities: admin-created, assigned to one or more members, with status and due dates
- Feed: posts and comments (replaces full chat for MVP)
- Notifications: in-app list for invites, tasks, and event updates
- Media: image uploads for profiles, community, and events
- Finance: contribution requests, split amounts, and settlement tracking

Phase 2 (near-term enhancements)
- Public community pages with richer descriptions
- Admin analytics for engagement and attendance
- Configurable reminder schedules
- Expanded file management for documents
- More granular roles and permissions

Phase 3 (longer-term)
- Online payments and automated dues
- Advanced reports and exports
- Integrations (calendar sync, email digests)
- Subscription plans and feature gating

Out of scope for MVP
- Full real-time chat with moderation features
- Payment processing and payouts
- Large-scale reporting and advanced analytics

This document is intentionally focused on scope clarity to keep Grove fast to ship and easy to use.
