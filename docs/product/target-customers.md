Grove is built for community groups that outgrow group chat but do not need enterprise tools.

Primary segments
- Local civic and neighborhood groups (parks, cleanups, residents associations)
- Faith and cultural organizations (temples, churches, mosques, community festivals)
- Volunteer and charity teams (food drives, fundraising, animal rescue)
- Sports and hobby clubs (cricket, running, cycling, book clubs)
- Parent and school groups (PTA, class committees)

Shared needs across segments
- Clear events and RSVP tracking
- Meeting minutes with action items
- Volunteer coordination and task ownership
- Shared documents and photos
- Transparent financial tracking

Buyer and influencer profile
- Community organizers and admins are the primary decision makers
- Members adopt quickly when setup is simple and reminders are reliable

Early adopters
- Local groups already managing budgets or regular events
- Communities frustrated by WhatsApp chaos and spreadsheet overhead

This focus keeps Grove relevant, practical, and immediately useful.
