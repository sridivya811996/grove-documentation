title: Idea origin
---

Grove began as a response to a simple observation: real community groups run on fragile tools. WhatsApp threads, scattered spreadsheets, and ad-hoc emails make it hard to stay organized, inclusive, and transparent.

The idea is to provide a calm, structured space for community life without feeling like enterprise software. Grove keeps what people like about chat, while adding clarity around events, decisions, tasks, and finances.

Key guiding beliefs:
- Community software must feel friendly, not bureaucratic.
- The least tech-savvy member should still feel comfortable.
- Every community has the same recurring needs: events, minutes, tasks, shared files, and money tracking.

This documentation defines how we bring that vision to life.
